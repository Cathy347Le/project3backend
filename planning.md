# Petz

### Description

A social media app for pets, find your favorite pets, comment, lick, and create a profile for your pet!

### Delegate Tasks

All team members would like to work on the front and back end. In order to accomplish that, the project tasks will be delegated base on features. Team members will be responsible for making sure a certain feature works on both the front and back end.
