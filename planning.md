# Petz

### Description

A social media app for pets, find your favorite pets, comment, lick, and create a profile for your pet!

### Delegate Tasks

All team members would like to work on the front and back end. In order to accomplish that, the project tasks will be delegated based on features. Team members will be responsible for making sure a certain feature works on both the front and back end. In order to get a core app with basic functionality, we did split tasks up on frontend/backend: Konjo made some initial React frontend pages, Cathy handled the Pets API, and Annabelle took care of the Comments API.

### Git Work Flow

Most of our work will be in the development branch. Feature branches will be created from the development branch. Weâ€™ll only merge to master when we deploy.
